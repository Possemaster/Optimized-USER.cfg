INSTRUCTIONS
1. Move USER.cfg file to Star Citizen installation folder *\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE

2. Open USER.cfg with Notepad or any text editor, follow instructions inside to set-up file for your system and then save changes when finished.

3. Navigate to *Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\Star Citizen\<current SC version>
